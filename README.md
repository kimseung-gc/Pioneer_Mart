## Project Description

We plan to build a mobile application that provides a campus-based online platform for buying and selling second-hand products, as well as requesting and providing services, within the Grinnell community. With this app, Grinnellians will be able to easily exchange second-hand products and services, such as textbooks, dorm supplies, transportation, and haircuts. The target users of the app will be the Grinnell College community. 

Notable competitors include Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, and Poshmark. Etsy is an online marketplace that allows users to buy and sell handmade items with an emphasis on arts & crafts. Poshmark is also an online marketplace that allows users to buy and sell clothing, home goods, beauty products and more. While platforms like Etsy and Poshmark serve as notable competitors, our app differentiates itself by being exclusively accessible to individuals with a Grinnell College email address. This ensures a secure, college-focused marketplace tailored specifically to the needs of Grinnellians. The common user will be Grinnell College students, faculty, and staff.
