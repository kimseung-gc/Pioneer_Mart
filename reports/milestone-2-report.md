# Important Decisions

## Frameworks & Languages
- React Native for UI
- TypeScript
- SQL for online database and server communications
- Python (Django) for backend

## Tools
- Trello for project management
- Microsoft Teams for all group communication

### React Native
We chose React Native to create the UI and frontend application logic primarily because it's a cross-platform framework which means we only have to maintain one codebase. This makes the development process much faster and will let us maintain the code with a lot more ease. It's also widely used in the industry which is why there's a lot of community support and great documentation.

### TypeScript
TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript and adds static typing which is easier for code maintainence and makes our code less prone to errors. TypeScript works really well with React Native.

### Django
Django is one of the most popular frameworks for developing web apps. It works well with React Native. One of the main reasons we chose this for our backend is that the two people on our team working on the backend prefer using Python which made Django an easy choice. It's flexible when it comes to application development, offering tons of features like built-in authentication.

### Trello
Trello is a well-known project management tool. Since we're working in a team and one of the members had already used this platform, we decided to adopt it for our development process.

### Microsoft Teams
Everyone on our team has access to Teams.
